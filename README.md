## Welcome to USACO-practice
Here are my solutions to hundreds of competitive programming problems! This is my journey through USACO and beyond, which dates all the way back to 2023.

* Includes problems from USACO, CSES, Codeforces, LeetCode, etc, some of which are my contest submissions.
* I'm extremely thankful for the contributors of [USACO Guide](https://usaco.guide/), which has been an amazing prep resource!
